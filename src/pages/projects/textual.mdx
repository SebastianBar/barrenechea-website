<a href="https://www.codeux.com/textual" target="_blank">Textual</a> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" target="_blank">IRC</a> client for macOS. I got to know IRC back when I was a kid. It certainly blew my mind at that time to be able to communicate with random people all around the world.

Back at the beginning of 2022, I installed <a href="https://openwrt.org" target="_blank">OpenWRT</a> on a Ubiquiti Access Point, and they stated that they have an IRC presence on the <a href="https://www.oftc.net" target="_blank">OFTC network</a>, so I found Textual as an excellent IRC client (an "upgrade" from my old <a href="https://www.mirc.com" target="_blank">mIRC</a>/<a href="https://www.ircap.com" target="_blank">IRcap</a> combo).

Textual is technically free (since it is an open source project), but it has what they call a "License Manager" whose only goal is to support the project's developers. Thankfully, it's just a couple of variables that I tweaked during the pipeline execution to disable it.

It was just a fun small project for me to test my abilities with pipelines and macOS binaries. Textual is excellent. You should definitely support them.
